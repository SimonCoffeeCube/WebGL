This repo contains a simple graphics engine that is built with JavaScript and uses the WebGL graphics library.

My hope is that this will be useful to anyone who wants a guide on getting WebGL to work.

The code is covered under a MIT License.

I wrote this back in 2014 and then when I was recenlty thinking about creating some simple games, remembered 
that I had this code and so reworked it to make it suitable for a first person perspective game.

To get this to work then download all the files to your computer and then copy them to the html directory on your machine's webserver. 

Both the Mac and Windows systems come with a built in web server that you can use. Otherwise something like Apache will be perfect.

If you try and run the project by just loading fps.html ( and without using a webserver ) then you will just get a screen of red polygons.

Any questions then let me know.

Thanks

Simon
